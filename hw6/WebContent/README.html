<h1>Known and Bugs and Interface Issues:</h1>
	<p>Mysql Database is sometimes very slow - sometimes loading pages with information that is not up to date
	</p><p> If a user goes to a page not related to making quizzes while making a quiz, that quiz will be lost
	</p><p>You can make blank answers, which could be ok if you wan't the correct answer to a question to be blank. 
	</p><p> There are times when if you let the session expire, the page will not fail gracefully</p>
